## 1. What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment and management of applications within containers. Containers are lightweight and isolated environments that provide consistent and reproducible application execution.

## 2. What is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, adds dependencies, sets environment variables, copies files, and defines commands to run within the container.

Example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use a base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y <dependency>

# Set environment variables
ENV PORT=8080

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## 3. How do you build a Docker image from a Dockerfile?

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, you can use the docker build command followed by the directory containing the Dockerfile.

Example command:

```
docker build -t myimage:latest .
```

## 4. How do you run a Docker container?

To run a Docker container, you can use the docker run command followed by the image name.

Example command:

```arduino
docker run myimage:latest
```

## 5. What is a Docker registry?

A Docker registry is a storage system for Docker images. It can be public or private and allows you to store and distribute Docker images across multiple systems.

## 6. How do you push a Docker image to a Docker registry?

To push a Docker image to a Docker registry, you need to tag the image with the registry URL and then use the docker push command.

Example commands:

```bash
docker tag myimage:latest registry.example.com/myimage:latest
docker push registry.example.com/myimage:latest
```

## 7. How do you scale Docker containers in a cluster using Docker Compose?

To scale Docker containers in a cluster, you can use Docker Compose and specify the desired number of replicas for a service.
Example Docker Compose file:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    image: myimage:latest
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
```

## 8. How do you persist data in Docker containers?

To persist data in Docker containers, you can use Docker volumes or bind mounts. Volumes are managed by Docker and provide better isolation, while bind mounts reference a specific directory on the host system.

Example Docker volume:

```arduino
docker run -v myvolume:/data myimage:latest
```

## 9. What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses YAML files to configure the services, networks, and volumes required by the application.

## 10. How do you link containers in Docker?

In Docker, container linking is an older method for connecting containers together. However, the preferred method is to use Docker networks, which provide better isolation and functionality.

## 11. How do you remove Docker images and containers?

To remove Docker images and containers, you can use the docker rm and docker rmi commands.

Example commands:

```bash
docker rm container_id
docker rmi image_id
```

## 12. What is the difference between a Docker container and an image?

A Docker image is a template that contains all the dependencies and configuration required to run an application. A Docker container is an instance of an image that is running as a process on a host.
